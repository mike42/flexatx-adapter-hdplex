# Flex ATX Adapter Plate for HDPLEX

This repository contains the FreeCAD design file for a simple adapter plate. It allows mounting a power cable in a computer case opening which is intended for a Flex ATX power supply.

I designed it to fit the C6 cable which ships with the HDPLEX GaN 250 power supply, and laser cut it in 1mm steel via a prototype manufacturer.

At the time of making this, HDPlex offers options for SFX and ATX brackets, but not for Flex ATX.
